For Mohsin, that began on the high streets of Manchester, selling, learning, and building from the ground up. His early ventures in fashion taught him more than the mechanics of trade; they taught him rhythm, resilience, and responsibility.From independent labels to large-scale retail distribution, he developed a deep understanding of what drives business growth- discipline, timing, and trust. Those lessons became the bedrock of everything that followed.

It was an abrupt pause, a moment of stillness that demanded uncomfortable honesty and a clear-eyed look at the choices, influences, and environments that shape a career.
But instead of allowing that chapter to diminish him, Mohsin confronted it with responsibility and resolve. He accepted the consequences, stood firm in accountability, and used the experience as an inflection point, a line between who he had been and who he was determined to become.
This chapter did not break his trajectory; it defined the strength behind it.
It gave him conviction, direction, and a renewed commitment to building a legacy rooted in transparency, discipline, and purpose.
